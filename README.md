# Mixing Layers Project

Welcome to the Mixing Layers project for the UC Berkeley ULAB Project. Here we will be sharing our research files for our exploration of mixing layers in the interstellar medium. 

Within the Data folder we will be holding data files for all our runs of the simulation. Within the Pgen folder we will have the standard problem generator for the mixing layer simmulation. This is an Athena++ problem generator. Within the input folder we will have the standard input file for the mixing layer simulation.

Our initial standard values for input values can be found in the input file. We used CGS units for all data analysis and simulations.
